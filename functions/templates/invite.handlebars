        <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>I'm Lindsay from Free Radicals. We're a group of artists, technologists, and friends, interested in improving the world around usâ€”and meeting new inspiring people along the way.</p>
        <p><strong>{{ user.firstName }} {{ user.lastName }}</strong> suggested we invite you to our fall party, In Good Company, benefiting the charity <a href="https://missamazing.org/">Miss Amazing</a>.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to bring together New York's best thinkers around arts & technology to dance, drink cocktails, and hang out with causes we support.</p> Hopefully out of this will come great connections and a better world overall.</p>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>When:</strong> October 14th, 2017 @ 8PM</li>
          <li><strong>Where:</strong> Location announced the week of the party.</li>
          <li><strong>Tickets:</strong> $25. Includes all cocktails, beer, wine & snacks for the evening. All profits go to Miss Amazing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <a class="button" href="https://wearefreeradicals.org/{{ params.uid }}/{{ params.iid }}">RSVP!</a>
        </p>
        <p>I hope you can make it. Make sure to RSVP. And, feel free to email if you have questions (info@wearefreeradicals.org)!</p>
        <p>--Lindsay & the rest of the Free Radicals</p>
      <p>PS. We're completely non-profit and all proceeds from each event go to the charity we select!</p>
