        <p>Hey!</p>
        <p>Thanks for RSVP'ing for In Good Company. We're really excited that you're coming!</p>
        <p>If you haven't yet, make sure to invite anyone you'd like to have join using your <a href="https://wearefreeradicals.org/profile">invite page</a>. The event will sell out extremely quickly and we'd hate to miss your friends!</p>
        <p>We'll send an email with directions to the venue the week of the party. When you get there, just let the doorman know your name.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Oh, and here's your donation receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>**placeholder**</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Have questions? Send us an email (info@wearefreeradicals.org). Looking forward to seeing you on the 14th!</p>
